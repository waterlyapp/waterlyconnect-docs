# External User Directory API

This API definition serves as a contract for external parties to implement, allowing
Waterly to query and update external systems as user data and/or permissioning is configured within the Waterly system.

This is an early stage API, please contact the [Waterly Support Team](mailto:support@waterlysoftware.com) if you have
interest in this API.
